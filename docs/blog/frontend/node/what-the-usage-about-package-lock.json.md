title: What the usage about package-lock.json
---

> In frontend project, you can see it file which named about package-lock.json. But what What is its significance, this post will tell you.

For the package.json file, each dependency has its own version represented by semver. It defines the rules for version number.

The version number consists of three parts: `major.minor.patch`

- `patch`: bug fix but don't have break change
- `minor`: new feature but don't have break change
- `major`: have break change, incompatibilities may occur

## How to specify the version of the dependency package to install

In `package.json` file, as you can see, the version number will be preceded by a ^ or ~ symbol.

- `~`: It will match the most recent minor version dependencies, such as ~1.2.3 will match all 1.2.x versions, but not 1.3.0.
- `^`: It will match them most recent major version dependencies, such as ^1.2.3 will match all 1.x.x versions, but not 2.0.0.
- `*`: It will match all version dependencies.

## The problem of installing package when developing by multiple people

When we use ^ or ~ to control the dependency package version number, multiple people develop, there may be cases where the dependency package versions installed by everyone are different, and the results of the project run are different.

**For example:**

we suppose install `vue` in the project. The `vue` version in `package.json` file is `vue: ^3.0.0` when we run command: `npm install vue --save`.

After a while, `vue` has released a new version 3.0.1. At this time, a new colleague clone the project from github and run `npm install`, the `vue` version of his computer was 3.0.1. **That's the problem!** Because `^` symbol just locks the major version.

Theoretically, they should still be compatible, **but bugfix maybe affects the functionality we're using, and our application produces different results.**

In order to solve the problem that all dependency versions installed on different people's computer are consistent. **`package-lock.json` comes into being.**

## package-lock.json

The official documentation explains it this way: [package-lock.json](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/configuring-npm/package-lock-json)

**It is created to version (lock) the entire dependency tree.**

When we run `npm install` in a project, we automatically generate a `package-lock.json` file in the same directory as `package.json`. `package-lock.json` records some information about the project and the modules it depends on. **This will give you the same result on every installation. It doesn't matter what machine you're on or when you're installing it.**

The next time we run `npm install`, `npm` found that if there is a `package-lock.json` file in the project. **It will handle and install dependencies according to the contents of `package-lock.json` instead of `package.json`.**
